    <ol>
        <li>Pressure cook* or boil potatoes until they are well cooked. Once cool enough to handle, peel the skins and quarter each potato into 4 large pieces.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss the pieces in rice flour coating well, and keep aside.</li>
        <li>In a large non-stick wok / kadai, heat the oil. Add asafoetida and cumin seeds. Once the seeds splutter, add the coriander powder, cumin powder, red chilli powder, turmeric powder and SALT to the oil.</li>
        <li>Stir well so that all the spice powder including salt get cooked in oil.</li>
        <li>Do this on a low flame so that none of the spices burn. Immediately, throw in the rice flour tossed potato chunks, stirring gently to coat with the spices and oil.</li>
        <li>Cook them on a low flame until all the potato chunks get encrusted with spices, around 7-8 minutes, turning occasionally.</li>
        <li>Garnish with finely chopped coriander.</li>
